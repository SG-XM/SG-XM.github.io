I am a first-year PhD student at Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Lab, Tianjin University (TJU), advised by Assoc. Prof. Yan Zheng. I received my Master's degree from the Peking University.

My major research interests focus on AI Agents, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), and multiagent systems, especially in  scalable  multiagent.
